## About Me

🎓 My name is Azhar Nurgaliyeva, and I am a current M.Sc. student in Computing at Imperial College London.

💃🏻 Outside my studies, I enjoy making myself learn new skills. My hobbies range from **reading**, **solving puzzles**,
and **writing** to something more fun like **making bracelets**, **collecting cool stickers** and **dancing**.

📚 When it comes to reading, I enjoy such genres like **science/detective/mystery fiction** and anything *
*psychology-related** (from a more neuroscience rather than personal development point of view). My favorite ones are *
*The Shadow of the Wind** by _Carlos Ruiz Zafon_ and **The Science of Fate** by _Hannah Critchlow_.
